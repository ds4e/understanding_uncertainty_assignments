    "## Exam Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probability Spaces\n",
    "    - Outcomes/Sample Space, Events, Probabilities\n",
    "    - Probability Axioms ($p(\\varnothing)=0$; $p(Z)=1$; if $E_1, ..., E_n$ are disjoint, then $p(E_1 \\cup E_2 ... \\cup E_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(E_i)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Variables\n",
    "    - A random variable $X$ is a mapping from Sample Space to vectors of real numbers\n",
    "    - The cumulative distribution function (cdf) is $F(x) = p[X \\le x] = p(\\{z \\in Z: X(z) \\le x \\})$\n",
    "    - The probability density function (pdf) is $f(x) = F'(x)$, where it exists\n",
    "    - The probability mass function (pmf) is $m(x) = p(\\{X(z)=x\\})$\n",
    "    - Common distributions (there are many worth knowing, but in terms of muscle memory for an exam):\n",
    "        - Uniform\n",
    "        - Normal, log-normal\n",
    "        - Logistic\n",
    "        - Bernoulli\n",
    "        - Exponential\n",
    "        - Poisson\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "    - If $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ are independent random variables, then their joint density satisfies $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = f_{X_1}(x_1) f_{X_2}(x_2) ... f_{X_n}(x_n)$\n",
    "    - The likelihood of a set of data is the joint density of observing it, given the parameters $\\beta$: $L(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f_{X_i}(x_i; \\beta) $\n",
    "    - The log-likelihood is the log of the likelihood: $\\ell(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log( f_{X_i}(x_i; \\beta) ) $\n",
    "    - The **maximum likelihood estimator** is the parameter choice that maximizes the likelihood. Differentiate $\\ell(\\beta)$ with respect to $\\beta$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $\\hat{\\beta}_{MLE}$\n",
    "    - For the models we play with, the MLE usually looks something like a sample average or sample variance, or a transformation of one"

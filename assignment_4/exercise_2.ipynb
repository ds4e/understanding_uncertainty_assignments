    "### Exercise 2: Invitation to Inference\n",
    "- Run the simulation code line by line and comment what each line is doing, or write your own code to do the resampling\n",
    "- Open the NHANES or Ames prices or College Completion data. Pick a variable and a statistic to compute (e.g. mean, median, variance, IQR)\n",
    "- Use the `simulate` function from class to get a sample of estimates for your statistic and your data\n",
    "- Create a new function, `interval(L,H,estimates)`, that computes the $L$-th and $H$-th quantiles for your estimates, $H>L$\n",
    "- If $L=.05$ and $H=.95$, this is a **90-percent confidence interval**: \"For our statistic, this interval captures the true value of the population parameter 90 percent of the time. (We are 90% **confident** that it includes the true value of the parameter, but the probability that the true parameter lies in this interval is 0 or 1.)\"\n",
    "- We will spend much more time on this later in class, but for people who have done hypothesis testing before, you now know how to do it directly from the data: No central limit theorem required."
